# FVS Pharmacy 

FVS RDBMS is an inventory control system designed to efficiently model day to day operations of FVS Pharmacy stores.<br>
Before the ICS, all FVS Pharmacys had inefficient database structures that do not properly model the operations of the store.<br>
It is the purpose of this database system to provide an efficient, fast, and practical model for individual FVS Pharamcys.

ssn INT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
pos VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
salary INT NOT NULL,
status BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);
```

**pgAdmin 4**

The management tool used for the database is **[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)**<br>
pgAdmin 4 is a graphical user interface (GUI) management tool for postgreSQL databases.<br>
Below is a snippet of what the pgAdmin dashboard looks like
